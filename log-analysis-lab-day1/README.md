## 🎯 Objective
Introduce the basics of log analysis and simulate detection of PowerShell events using Windows Event Viewer.

## 📖 What is a Log?
A log is a record of system activity including:
- **Timestamp**
- **Event Description**
- **Severity**
- **Source**

Logs are used in **forensics, incident response**, and **compliance**.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Windows 10 / Windows Server
- PowerShell
- Event Viewer
- Group Policy Editor

## 🧪 Lab Task
Simulate suspicious PowerShell activity and detect it using Event Viewer.

## 💼 SOC Analyst Context
SOC Analysts rely on log analysis to:
- Detect and respond to threats
- Trace attacker behavior
- Maintain regulatory compliance
